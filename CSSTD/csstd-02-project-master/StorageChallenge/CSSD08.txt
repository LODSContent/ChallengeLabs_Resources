In this challenge you will use the following files:
- Models/CosmosDBTableContext.cs: You will add code to this file to interact with a private blob storage container.
- web.config: You will set the testType app setting to 32 in this file.

You will reference the following objects in your code:
- CSSTDModels.ICosmosDBTableContext: You will implement this interface for the CosmosDBTableContext class.

		//Create the ProductMentions table
        void CreateTable();

		//Retrieve all mentions
        List<IProductMention> GetMentions();

		//Retrieve a filtered list of mentions
        List<IProductMention> GetMentions(string product, string platform);

		//Load sample data into the table
        void LoadMentions(List<IProductMention> mentions);

- CSSTDModels.IProductMention: This class is used by the evaluation engine.  IProductMention objects will be passed into and out of methods you implement in the CosmosDBTableContext class.
    public interface IProductMention
    {
        [Description("Arbitrary ID for the mention.  Tied to RowKey value")]
        string MentionID { get; set; }

        [Description("Name of the product")]
        string Product { get; set; }

        [Description("Social media platform")]
        string Platform { get; set; }

        [Description("Date of the mention stored as a string")]
        string MentionedAt { get; set; }

        [Description("Content of mention")]
        string Mention { get; set; }
    }
